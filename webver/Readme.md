Webversion notes
===

1. **Folder Structure**

   We use the `site` subfolder to store all public webversion files. 
   Current folder contains **internal** files for webversion support that do not need to be published.

2. **Update Policy**

   The webversion is auto-updated through CI/CD workflow scripts. Any push triggers an automated build and deployment process, so no manual steps are required.
